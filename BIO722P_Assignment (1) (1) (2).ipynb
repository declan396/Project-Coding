Please remove your own test code.\n* Notebook includes the full name and student number of the author.\n* Zip file containing the notebook is free from errors.\n\nPlease refrain from editing the text of the assignment and the test code provided. Feel free to insert text or code cells as needed, but please clean up rough work that you do not wish to be marked.\n\n## Marking\n\nYour work will be marked based on:\n\n        completeness and correctness: 70% (may be assessed automatically)\n        coding style: 30% (holistic assessment)\n\nFor automatic marking to function appropriately, each of your answers **must** pass the tests provided when running the notebook from top to bottom on a fresh kernel. Code that does not pass the tests or is not run (directly or indirectly, e.g. a function calling another function) by the functions you are asked to implement will **not** be marked.\n\nThe test code provided with each question does **not** ensure that your submission is correct; it only ensures that it can be marked automatically. You will need to test your code independently for correctness; however, please remove your test code from your final submission, and do not submit any test data; the marking script will test your code with its own choice of data.\n\n## How to answer questions\n\nThis assignment contains four questions, that carry different weights and can in principle be tackled in any order. However, we suggest that you answer Question 2 before attempting Question 3.\n\nEach question will require you to code a few functions or classes. As you progress through the subquestions, you may have to rely on your answer to previous subquestions to perform some operations. Please call the relevant functions and avoid duplicating code.  \n\nDo not remove or edit the comments at the top of the answer cells - marking scripts depend on them.\n\n\n## Use of libraries and language features\n\nMost of the assignment can be solved using built in functions and types; you are free to import any module or package from the **Python standard library only** where required. Third party or non-standard libraries (including Biopython, numpy and Pandas) are not allowed except where specifically indicated. **In your solution, you should only use Python statements and constructs covered in the module**.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Please put any import statements here, according to the example.\n# Example:\nimport math # this would obviously be uncommented if you are importing the math library\nfrom Bio.Align import substitution_matrices","metadata":{"trusted":false},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Preliminary reading\n\nPlease read the PDF file ```BIO722P_Assignment_Background.pdf``` distributed with this assigment carefully before you start coding.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Question 1: Translation and reading frames [20 marks]","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Question 1.a: Reading frames\nWrite a function ```translate``` that takes a string containing a DNA sequence as its input and outputs a Python dictionary containing the translation of the sequence in all possible reading frames.

The function should return a dictionary with the filenames as its keys; the value associated to each key should be a tuple of floats, containing in order the percentages of polar, small and hydrophobic AAs, as listed in the file. So for instance, if the CSV file contains the lines used as an example in Question 2, ```readTable``` should return a dictionary containing at least the following items: \n```\n{ \"Pxxx.fasta\": (0.52, 0.22, 0.33),  \"Qx3Z.fas\": (0.47, 0.35, 0.38),\n... }\n```\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Q3b_ans - Your answer here - do not edit this comment\n#function reads csv-like table of AA type values into a dictionary\ndef readTable(filename):\n    table = {}   #store results\n\n    with open(filename) as f:\n        for line in f:\n            line = line.strip()\n            #skip commented lines\n            if not line.startswith(\"#\") and len(line) > 0:\n                parts = line.split(\",\")\n                name = parts[0]\n                p = float(parts[1])\n                s = float(parts[2])\n                h = float(parts[3])\n                table[name] = (p, s, h)\n\n    #return dict of filename: (p, s, h)\n    return table\n\n#test\ndata = readTable(\"AA_summary.csv\")\nprint(data)\n","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"{}\n"}],"execution_count":8},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Test code\nimport inspect\nassert 'readTable' in globals(), \"readTable not defined - check your spelling\"\nassert inspect.isfunction(readTable), \"readTable is not a function\"\nprint(\"OK\")","metadata":{"trusted":false},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Question 3.c: Computing a distance matrix \n\nWrite a function called ```distanceMatrix``` that takes as its argument three strings called ```inputfile```, ```outputfile``` and ```metric```, used to pass the names of the input and output file and for the choice of a metric. The function should use ```readTable``` to read from the input file CSV data created as specified at the end of Question 2 (again, you do not necessarily have to answer Question 2 in order to do this; you can create a CSV file with made-up data using an editor). Suppose data for N proteins are read. Your function should then create an output TSV file containing a matrix of size NxN (plus one row and one column for labels). The rows and columns of the matrix should correspond to individual protein file names, so that each matrix entry corresponds to a pair of proteins, say Pxxx and Pyyy. Such entry should contain the distance between the ```(polar, small, hydrophobic)``` tuples (considered as 3 dimensional vectors) corresponding to Pxxx and Pyyy; the ```metric``` parameter should select which distance in computed, as in Question 3.a above. If done correctly, your matrix should be symmetric and have zeroes on the diagonal. Output the matrix in TSV format with row and column labels as in the following 3-protein example (that contains random numbers and filenames):\n```\n# Filename      Pxxx.fas  Pyyy.fas  Pzzz.fas\nPxxx.fas        0.00      2.34      1.51\nPyyy.fas        2.34      0.00      1.82 \nPzzz.fas        1.51      1.82      0.00\n\n```\nThe exact alignment is not important, as long as the data are separated by tabs and the first line starts with a hash (```#```). Likewise, the order in which the proteins are listed is not important, provided the same order is used along the rows and along the columns. Do not add any quotes or other spurious characters.

The first element of a each tuple should precede the second element in alphabetical order or be equal to it.
