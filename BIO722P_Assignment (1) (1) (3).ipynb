    "* Notebook functions pass all tests when cells are run with a fresh kernel from top to bottom.\n",
    "* Notebook only contains well commented answer code and the original tests. Please remove your own test code.\n",

Third party or non-standard libraries (including Biopython, numpy and Pandas) are not allowed except where specifically indicated. **In your solution, you should only use Python statements and constructs covered in the module**."

    "Write a function called ```distanceMatrix``` that takes as its argument three strings called ```inputfile```, ```outputfile``` and ```metric```, used to pass the names of the input and output file and for the choice of a metric. The function should use ```readTable``` to read from the input file CSV data created as specified at the end of Question 2 (again, you do not necessarily have to answer Question 2 in order to do this; you can create a CSV file with made-up data using an editor). Suppose data for N proteins are read. Your function should then create an output TSV file containing a matrix of size NxN (plus one row and one column for labels). The rows and columns of the matrix should correspond to individual protein file names, so that each matrix entry corresponds to a pair of proteins, say Pxxx and Pyyy. Such entry should contain the distance between the ```(polar, small, hydrophobic)``` tuples (considered as 3 dimensional vectors) corresponding to Pxxx and Pyyy; the ```metric``` parameter should select which distance in computed, as in Question 3.a above. If done correctly, your matrix should be symmetric and have zeroes on the diagonal. Output the matrix in TSV format with row and column labels as in the following 3-protein example (that contains random numbers and filenames):\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Filename      Pxxx.fas  Pyyy.fas  Pzzz.fas\n",

    "The exact alignment is not important, as long as the data are separated by tabs and the first line starts with a hash (```#```). Likewise, the order in which the proteins are listed is not important, provided the same order is used along the rows and along the columns. Do not add any quotes or other spurious characters. Your function should not return any value."

The first element of a each tuple should precede the second element in alphabetical order or be equal to it.
